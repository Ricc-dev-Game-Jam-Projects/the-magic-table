# The Magic Table

This is a game in which you need to combine some items to create others in order to increase your productivity and sell the items to aliens who are curious to learn how humans do it from scratch to build these buildings.

# Wiki

The game would have a lot more craftings but there was no time to do what we would like, it would have very crazy items from aliens in addition to negotiations with them. In addition, you could position objects, such as barricades, to defend yourself from aliens who want to attack you, as they did not like your negotiation!

But for now, what we have is a "crafting table" where you can combine objects to form others, follow the list of objects that you can craft.

* 5x Wooden Stick -> 5x Wooden Logs
* Wooden Hammer -> 3x Wooden Stick + 1x Wooden Log
* Stone Hammer -> 3x Wooden Stick + 1x Refined Stone
* Refined Stone -> 1x Stone
* 5x Wooden Plank -> 1x Wooden Log + 1x Stone Hammer
* Crafting Table -> 4x Wooden Stick + 5x Wooden Plank

To obtain stone you need to make a wooden hammer and position it in the defined slot.

# Game Development
First was to create a brainstorming to see what ideas could fit in the game jam.

Then we analysed which were simpler, cause we started lately and don't have so much time to game dev.

Finally we started to develop.

Game Engine used was Unity 2019.3.2f1, we also used json.net package.

All arts and codes were made from scratch.

Font got from google.
